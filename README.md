##WORK IN PROGRESS##

Version 0.1.0
-All basic math functionality has been added to provide final UKC calculation

KNOWN ISSUES:
-Manual input is required to enter low tide information. Future versions are to include functionality to estimate the height of tide during passage over shallowest water.
-Tide data graph is a bit crowded and hard to read. tkinter is a wierd library that I don't know how to use very well.
-All calculations are currently in meters. Future versions to include entry and output in feet (and fathoms)

ukcDatumFork.py is a dead fork to fix an issue with the noaa_coops library that has been fixed by calling the NOAA webapp directly.
